# Serialization is the act of transforming an object into another data format.
# After transforming an object we can save it to a file or send it through the network.

# Why serialization is necessary?
# Think of a Django model: itâ€™s a Python class. How do you render a Python class to JSON in a browser?
# With a Django REST serializer!

# A serializer works the other way around too: it converts JSON to objects.
# This way you can:
# display Django models in a browser by converting them to JSON
# make CRUD request with a JSON payload to the API

# To recap: a Django REST serializer is mandatory for operating on models through the API.
